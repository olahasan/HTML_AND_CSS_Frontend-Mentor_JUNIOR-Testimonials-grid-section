## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout. I also practiced using CSS custom properties for maintaining a consistent color scheme and improved my understanding of responsive design with media queries.

```css
.boxs .container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on improving accessibility by using more semantic HTML tags and adding ARIA labels where necessary. I also aim to further optimize my CSS by grouping similar styles together.
